This Discord bot would not be possible without the service provided by [DolarApi](https://dolarapi.com/docs/) & [ArgentinaDatos](https://argentinadatos.com/) which provide me with the updated exchange rates.

Make requests to external APIs: Use the /request command to fetch data from any public API.
